* 

### 2. Scope
I have decided to keep th

* Learn more about the project
* Easy way to apply to become a volunteers
* Contact with a question
* Visit social media channels

### 3. Structure

The main goal here is to allow users to quickly assimilate the information. The fixed navigation bar for the desktop screen and fixed footer for the smaller screens was one of the most important things because with it the user always will be close to a donation button. 

Although the main goal of the website is to get more donations, I did not want to look like the project is just about money. With this in mind, I made it clear that be a volunteer or share the project on social media was a big help as well.

* Home, About, Volunteering, Galerry, and Contact Section.

* Fixed navigation bar on large screens with the menu headings and donate button.

* Fixed Footer on small screens with social media icons and donate button.


### 5. Structure
**Colours**: As the project already had pages on social media with defined colors, I decided to keep basically keep the same style.
I used to main colors a dark yellow #F18E04 and a standard brown #5C411A, which provides a good contrast.

**Typography**: In the beginning, I wanted to use a different font for headings and general text, but choosing Work Sans was great because it looks nice for both cases.
I only used Signika for the pictures on the carousel because it looked better.

**Images**: All the images were provided by You in Africa.
