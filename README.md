### 2. Scope
I have decided to keep th

* Learn more about the project
* Easy way to aply to become a volunteers
* Contact with a question
* Visit social media channels

### 3. Structure

The main goal here is to allow users to quickly assimilate the information. The fixed navigation bar for desktop screen and fixed footer for smaller screen was one of the most import thing because with it the user always will be close to a donation button. 

Although the main goal of the website is get more donations, I did not want to look like the project is just about money. Wirh this in mind, I made clear that be a volunteer or share the project on social medias was a big help as well.

### 5. Structure
**Colours**: As the project already had pages on social media with defined colours, I decided to keep basically keep the same style.
I used to main colours a dark yellow #F18E04 and a stantard brown #5C411A, what provides a good contrast.

**Typography**: In the beggining I wanted to use different font for headings and general text, but choosing Work Sans was great because it looks nice for both cases.
I only used Signika for the pictures on the carousel because it looked better.

**Images**: All the images were provided by You in Africa.
