## User Experience


### 1. Strategy
Project Goals:

* To learn about what the project is.

* To be able to easily donate and increase donations.

* Create a website that is visually appealing, and fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

Customer Goals:
* Website clear and user friendly. Explain as much as possible about the project, but keep it short and simple to not overwhelm.

* Easy way to donate.

* Inspire people to become a volunteer.

### 2. Scope
I kept the project simple enough to be understood with no difficult and the user have a good experience

* Learn more about the project

* Easy way to donate

* Easy way to apply to become a volunteers

* Contact with a question

* Visit social media channels

* I used some animations to make de user experience more pleasent and enchanting

### 3. Structure

The main goal here is to allow users to quickly assimilate the information. The fixed navigation bar for the desktop screen and fixed footer for the smaller screens was one of the most important things because with it the user always will be close to a donation button. 

Although the main goal of the website is to get more donations, I did not want to look like the project is just about money. With this in mind, I made it clear that be a volunteer or share the project on social media was a big help as well.

### 4. Skeleton

* [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframe.pdf)

* Home, About, Volunteering, Galerry, and Contact Section.

* Fixed navigation bar on large screens with the menu headings and donate button.

* Fixed Footer on small screens with social media icons and donate button.


### 5. Surface

**Colours**: As the project already had pages on social media with defined colors, I decided to keep basically keep the same style.
I used to main colors a dark yellow #F18E04 and a standard brown #5C411A, which provides a good contrast.

**Typography**: In the beginning, I wanted to use a different font for headings and general text, but choosing Work Sans was great because it looks nice for both cases.
I only used Signika for the pictures on the carousel because it looked better.

**Images**: All the images were provided by You in Africa.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

1. All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.

2. The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.

3. Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.

4. Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.

5. Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

6. There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

7. The code can be run locally through clone or download.

8. You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button, and selecting either 'clone or download'.

9. The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.

10. The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file that can be unzipped on your local machine.

## Credits

### Content

Most of the content was provided from the [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/youinafricaoficial/) of You in Africa. I just had to translate and made a few modifications to make more sense for English speakers. I also had the fundamental help from the volunteers of the project who helped with beautiful testimonies.

### Media

All the images were provided from You in Africa team. I only had to edit some images.

### Code

I used a lot of flex-boxes on my project, I searched a lot on Google about it, but this particular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc) helped a lot to understand it deeper.
